# This is a simple todo-app made with jQuery
As usual todo-app user can input tasks, which will save in users local storage.
User can add tasks, check and delete tasks. Also in additional user can use buttons "Switch check" (which works as switch for checked and unchecked todo's).
In this project user can also delete all checked todos, which made to improve users experience.
If user have an empty todo input and press "Add!", it will alert user "Looks like you missing the task."
